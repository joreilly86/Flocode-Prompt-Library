# Flocode Prompt Library

**Engineering-First AI Prompts**

A curated collection of recursive, battle-tested prompts designed specifically for engineering professionals. Each prompt is crafted to be a **force multiplier**â€”generating other specialized prompts, frameworks, and workflows that scale across multiple engineering domains.

Check out the [**Flocode Newsletter ðŸŒŠ**](https://flocode.substack.com/) for more similar tools and insights.

## Why This Library Exists

Engineering teams need AI assistants that understand:
- **Safety-critical requirements** and code compliance
- **Professional standards** and verification protocols  
- **Technical precision** without marketing fluff
- **Scalable workflows** that work across projects

This library provides prompts that **generate other prompts**, creating a multiplier effect for your engineering AI toolkit.

## ðŸ“¢ Important Note on Professional Responsibility

**You remain fully responsible** for validating and verifying all AI-generated outputs. Use these prompts within your professional competency and risk tolerance. Engineering judgment and due diligence are always required.

## Core Prompts (Start Here)

These are your **force multipliers**â€”prompts that create other specialized prompts:

### [Recursive Prompt Generator](core-prompts/prompt-generator.md)
**Purpose:** Generate specialized AI prompts for any engineering domain  
**Value:** One prompt that creates unlimited domain-specific assistants  

### [Context Engineering Framework](core-prompts/context-engineering-framework.md)  
**Purpose:** Generate systematic project structures and workflows  
**Value:** Transform any complex engineering project into a structured AI-assisted workflow  

## Specialized Prompts

Pre-built assistants for common engineering needs:

- **[Professional Engineering AI Assistant](specialized/engineering-ai-assistant.md)** - Comprehensive PE-level support with code compliance
- **[Personal Engineering Assistant](specialized/personal-engineering-assistant.md)** - Python-focused technical support  
- **[Technical Writing Assistant](specialized/technical-writing-assistant.md)** - Engineering document compliance and style

## Quick Start (2 Minutes)

1. **Choose your approach:**
   - Need a custom assistant? â†’ Use [Prompt Generator](core-prompts/prompt-generator.md)
   - Have a complex project? â†’ Use [Context Framework](core-prompts/context-engineering-framework.md)  
   - Want immediate help? â†’ Pick a [Specialized](specialized/) prompt

2. **Copy the prompt** into your AI tool (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

## What Makes These Prompts Different

### 1. **Recursive Design**
Unlike single-use prompts, these generate other specialized tools. One investment, multiple returns.

### 2. **Battle-Tested**
Proven effective in real projects across mining, power, water, and infrastructure sectors.
