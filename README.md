# Flocode Prompt Library

## **AI Prompts For Professional Engineers**

A collection of recursive prompts designed for engineering professionals. These prompts generate other specialized prompts, frameworks, and workflows that scale across multiple engineering domains.

Check out the [**Flocode Newsletter ðŸŒŠ**](https://flocode.substack.com/) for more similar tools and insights.

## Why This Library Exists

Engineering teams need AI assistants that understand:

- **Safety-critical requirements** and code compliance
- **Professional standards** and verification protocols  
- **Technical precision** without marketing fluff
- **Scalable workflows** that work across projects

This library provides prompts that generate other prompts, enabling customized AI assistants for specific engineering domains.

## ðŸ“¢ Important Note on Professional Responsibility

**You remain fully responsible** for validating and verifying all AI-generated outputs. Use these prompts within your professional competency and risk tolerance. Engineering judgment and due diligence are always required.

## Core Prompts (Start Here)

Prompts that create other specialized prompts:

### [Recursive Prompt Generator](core-prompts/prompt-generator.md)

**Purpose:** Generate specialized AI prompts for any engineering domain  
Creates domain-specific AI assistants for engineering disciplines  

### [Context Engineering Framework](core-prompts/context-engineering-framework.md)  

**Purpose:** Generate systematic project structures and workflows  
Creates structured AI-assisted workflows for complex engineering projects  

## Specialized Prompts

Pre-built assistants for common engineering needs:

- **[Professional Engineering AI Assistant](specialized/engineering-ai-assistant.md)** - Comprehensive PE-level support with code compliance
- **[Personal Engineering Assistant](specialized/personal-engineering-assistant.md)** - Python-focused technical support  
- **[Technical Writing Assistant](specialized/technical-writing-assistant.md)** - Engineering document compliance and style

## Quick Start (2 Minutes)

1. **Choose your approach:**
   - Need a custom assistant? â†’ Use [Prompt Generator](core-prompts/prompt-generator.md)
   - Have a complex project? â†’ Use [Context Framework](core-prompts/context-engineering-framework.md)  
   - Want immediate help? â†’ Pick a [Specialized](specialized/) prompt

2. **Copy the prompt** into your AI tool (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

## What Makes These Prompts Different

### 1. **Recursive Design**

These prompts generate other specialized tools rather than serving single functions.

### 2. **Engineering-Focused**

Designed for professional engineering applications across mining, power, water, and infrastructure sectors.
